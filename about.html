            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am Ovye Gideon Ashlame, an 18-year-old Software Engineering student at Babcock University.
                With a deep passion for coding and web development, I am constantly exploring new technologies
                and honing my skills to build innovative digital solutions. My academic journey in the School
                of Computing has fueled my curiosity about software design, problem-solving, and the ever-evolving
                tech landscape. I enjoy working on web-based projects, learning new programming languages, and
                staying up to date with industry trends.</p>
            <p>Beyond academics, I am driven by a strong desire to create efficient, user-friendly applications
                that can make a real-world impact. Whether itâ€™s front-end design or back-end logic, I love the
                challenge of bringing ideas to life through code. My goal is to continuously improve, collaborate
                with other tech enthusiasts, and contribute to the digital world in meaningful ways. As I progress
                in my career, I look forward to gaining hands-on experience, working on exciting projects, and
                growing as a software developer.
